# Locale and Type Declaration

When using `typed-locale`, it's important to properly define your translation objects and their corresponding types. This ensures type safety throughout your application and provides excellent autocompletion in your IDE.

## Creating Translation Objects

First, let's create a translation object for the default language (usually English):

```typescript
import {plural} from 'typed-locale';

export const en = {
  hello: 'Hello',
  helloName: 'Hello, {{name}}',
  youHaveMessages: plural({
    none: 'You have no messages',
    one: 'You have 1 message',
    other: 'You have {{count}} messages',
  }),
} as const;
```

Note the use of `as const` at the end of the object. This is crucial for TypeScript to infer the most specific types possible.

## Defining Types

After creating your translation object, you should define its type using the `InferTranslation` utility type provided by `typed-locale`:

```typescript
import {InferTranslation} from 'typed-locale';

type Translation = InferTranslation<typeof en>;
```

This `Translation` type will now represent the structure of your translations, including all nested objects and pluralization rules.

## Creating Other Language Objects

For other languages, you can create objects that conform to the `Translation` type:

```typescript
export const fr: Translation = {
  hello: 'Bonjour',
  helloName: 'Bonjour, {{name}}',
  youHaveMessages: plural({
    none: 'Vous n'avez aucun message',
    one: 'Vous avez 1 message',
    other: 'Vous avez {{count}} messages',
  }),
};
```

If you're working on a new language and don't have all translations ready yet, you can use `InferPartialTranslation`:

```typescript
import {InferPartialTranslation} from 'typed-locale';

export const de: InferPartialTranslation<Translation> = {
  hello: 'Hallo',
  helloName: 'Hallo, {{name}}',
  // youHaveMessages can be added later
};
```

This allows you to gradually add translations without TypeScript complaining about missing keys.

## Creating a Dictionary

Once you have your translation objects, you can create a dictionary:

```typescript
const dictionary = {en, fr, de};
```

This dictionary can then be used to create a translator, as shown in the "Create Translator" section of the documentation.

By following these steps, you ensure that your translations are type-safe and that you'll get proper IDE support when using them throughout your application.
